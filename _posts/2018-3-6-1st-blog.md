title: <del>Industrial</del> Trip to Goa
---

This is my first blog as such on the internet so tolerate my horrifying english xD. I was about to write my experiences during the week-long industrial trip to Goa. Basically we have to undergo one industrial visit during Spring semester of 3rd year. From many years our seniors went to Goa for this visit so it was obvious that we will be also visiting this state for our so called industrial trip. Along with our EE branch(120 students), many big branches such as Mech, Civil, ECE also planned their industrial visit to Goa. Approximately budget for a person is Rs.12,000 allocated by our department. 

**Travel To Goa** <br/>
Bus to Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station in Delhi was waiting for us at 2:00 am on 24th Feb. We sat on the bus and then reaches Delhi at 6:00 am. After taking breakfast i.e. Masala Dosa(poor!) at station, we sat on the platform for 2 hours waiting for train to arrive. Then Delhi-Goa Rajdhani Express has arrived and hence we start our journey. In train, after approx. every 1 hour, some food arrives which never let building up our appetite. Our train only stops at major station, so our journey passed smoothly, playing cards(most of the time), dumsharas, mafia, and watching India's match.
